Getting Started
====================


Your first project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Set up your first project**

::

   $ debops-init ~/myproject
   $ cd ~/myproject

**Add a host to your inventory**

Enter your hosts into ``ansible/inventory/hosts``. For the beginning
we suggest entering one server only so you can make yourself
comfortable with DebOps. Here is an example::

  [all my servers]
  server1   hostname=serverone.example.com


**Verify you can access the server**

::

   $ ssh serverone.example.com
   $ debops-task all -m setup



.. WARNING::
   Ansible does not detect all platforms as detailed as it is
   required. Thus for some platforms running debops without any
   configuration will bring your system into a bad state. Please check
   `Notes about specific platforms`_ for more information. Sorry!

Before running debops the first time, we suggest you set up a minimal
configuration. This will make you more comfortable with the results.
For the very first try, you can put this into
``ansible/inventory/host_vars/server1.yml``::

  ntp_timezone: ['Europe', 'Paris']
  ssh_host_allow: [ '192.168.178.0/24' ]
  postfix_relayhost: 'mail.intern.example.com'
  postfix_default_local_alias_recipients: ['admin@example.com']


**Run the DebOps playbooks**

::

   $ debops


What you get after this
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* apt-repositories and auto-update
* Firewall and tcpwrapper set up
* local mail forwarded to your central mail-hub
* Time synchronization with `pool.debian.org`



Where to go from here
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may now start adding systems into ``ansible/inventory/hosts`` as
you like. To make install some software just add the host into the
resp. group and add some configuration options.

Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting up Etherpad quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``ansible/inventory/hosts``::

    [debops_etherpad]
    server1

* ``ansible/inventory/host_vars/server1.yml``::

    etherpad_title: 'Our Corporate Etherpad'
    etherpad_disable_ip_logging: True
    etherpad_admins: [ 'etherpad-admin' ]

After running ``debops -l server1`` you can access the running
etherpad on ``pad.example.com`` (given the hostname resolve
correctly). DebOps automatically installed and configured `nginx`,
`nodejs` and `mysql` (resp. `mariadb`) for you.


More Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find more examples in the `DebOps examples repository
<https://github.com/debops/examples>`_. If you have an example you
want to share, please submit a pull-request. We'd happily integrate it.



Notes about specific platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need additional configuration for a platform, we suggest
putting this into a ``group_vars``-file and put the affected systems
into a group within ``ansible/inventory/hosts``.

Debian
   nothing to consider
Ubuntu
   nothing to consider
Rapbian (Debian for Raspberry PI)
   Requires some setup::

     ansible_ssh_user: 'pi'
     # Work around missing detection of Raspbian in Ansible
     apt_default_sources_lookup: 'raspbian'
     apt_default_mirrors_lookup: 'raspbian'
